  abstract = {Computer-mediated discussion forums (such as newsgroups or those in instructional management software environments) are becoming common in higher education. Such forums are interesting because they ate not only one of the easiest technologies to add to a class but may also provide an important learning opportunity for students. However, simply making a discussion forum available does not mean that it will be used effectively to enable learning. In this paper, we explore the idea that specific features of a discussion forum may increase the likelihood of effective discussions taking place within the forum. We define effective discussions as those that are sustained and are focused on topics related to class learning goals. We then describe the specifications for an electronic discussion forum-a computer-mediated anchored discussion forum-that we propose makes sustained on-topic discussion more likely. We report on the results of two studies that support this proposal. We end by exploring implications for research into computer-supported discussion tools for learning and their design.},

However, precise conceptual and operational definitions of 'flaming' have yet to be established, which has implications for understanding this phenomenon. Consequently, we propose an interactional- normative framework that focuses on interpretations of messages from multiple perspectives in the situated and evolving context of appropriateness norms. This framework incorporates intentionality and individuals' strategic choices in language use and channel selection. We discuss the implications of this framework for research on flaming and other problematic interactions.}},
