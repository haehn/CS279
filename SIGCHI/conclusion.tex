\section{Future Work}

In our next steps, we plan to expand the participant pool to include participants of all ages and backgrounds, and to use a within-subjects methodology. In the future, we would like to explore if MindMargin causes increased difficulty for readers to leave inflamed comments because MindMargin forces them to choose an appropriate anchoring place for their comments. Finally, we plan to pursue research on a comparable commenting system to MindMargin, but used in videos and music, that anchors comments to certain times or time-intervals within a given recording. Research into annotations on visual pieces, such as anchoring user recommendations to product images, is also being considered.
