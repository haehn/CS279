\section{Future Work}
In the future, we plan to expand the participant pool to include participants of all ages and backgrounds. We would like to explore if MindMargin causes increased difficulty for readers to leave inflamed comments because they must choose an appropriate place to anchor their highly visible comment. Finally, we plan to pursue research on a commenting system like MindMargin, but for videos and music, that anchors comments to certain times or time-intervals within a given recording. Research into annotations on visual pieces, other than text, is also being considered.
