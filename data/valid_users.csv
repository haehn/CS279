After four years of teaching, I transitioned to the Kennedy School in response to Teach for America's theory of chance - I disagree that education is the thing that will singlehandedly eliminate poverty in urban areas.  With this belief, I am supportive of articles that question Teach for America's business model and challenge it to behave more responsibly.  I applaud the young writer of the article for doing interesting research and publishing a provocative piece; however, the article has some serious problems.  First, it makes many generalizations from anecdotes provided by the writer.  You cannot support a statement like, ""Teach for America leaves its teachers underprepared for the job"" with ""many Harvard graduates say they feel underprepared.""  How many graduates did she speak to?  What proportion would agree with that claim?  The author provides no evidence to suggest this is a fair generalization.  Also, the author makes inaccurate logical leaps.  She supports the claim that ""Teach for America is responsible for the privatization of public education"" with ""Teach for America is connected to dozens of charter schools.""  Charter schools are in fact publicly-funded, independently-operated schools.  She quickly makes this jump without verifying the reliability of her evidence or explaining how it justifies her initial claim.  However, overall, I think it's important to react charitably to these issues given that the author is a College Senior.","392125","regular","yes",,,"0"
