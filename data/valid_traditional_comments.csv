"57","TFA needs to focus on its true mission of providing underserved communities with dedicated student-teachers. It seems that TFA has become a solution seeking a problem recently - teachers must now find students to teach, and this could result in experienced teachers becoming replaced.","-1","2013-12-16 16:26:17","0","0","0","1","anonymous","Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; Trident/6.0; Touch)","30"

"61","I agree that you are making good points about how sending under-experienced college grads into the Public School System undermines the legitimacy of those teachers who made their way to the classroom the traditional way. However, what I do appreciate about TFA is that it is inviting ivy league college students to consider something else than the traditional right out of college Wall Street jobs. Whether TFA will entice Harvard students to either do something more valuable for the community permanently or just long enough to make Harvard students, many of whom have never had a real job, to appreciate what real labor is like.

"64","EternalStudent, it sounds like your sister is much more experienced than most who join TFA. It would be interesting to know how many of her fellow TFA teachers have the level of experience she does. Few if any of the friends and acquaintances I have intend to teach beyond their two-year commitment. Most have 'higher' aspirations - senator, banker, corporate lawyer. It's a shame to see so many intelligent people (and institutions!) blindly praising the TFA system. In many ways it reminds me of how people view 'international development'. Good intentions aren't enough, folks.","30","2013-11-29 20:07:26","0","0","0","0","anonymous","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.57 Safari/537.36","96"

However, I would also like to see some more information on exactly who TFA recruits and how rigorous their standards are for accepting teachers.","-1","2013-12-01 23:19:40","0","0","0","0","Giouli","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.57 Safari/537.36","119"

Standardized testing is not a bad thing. It is a good way of understanding how well one comprehends the material thought, until we can come up with a better way to assess a pupils progress, standardized testing is necessary. Were it not important, colleges wouldn't require SAT/ACTs, so i order to prepare on e for college and life, they must be tested on what they have been taught in order to assess just how easily they are able to apply whatever it is has been taught to them.
